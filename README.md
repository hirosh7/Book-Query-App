# Messenger App

The Messenger application is a smartphone safety application distinguished from all other apps because of its hands free engagement.  While all other safety applications require the user to touch their device to bring up the safety application, this one does not.  The application is ready at all times and 'listening' for a user defined 'safe' word in order to inform the preset contacts.
